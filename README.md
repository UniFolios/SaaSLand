## Getting Started &nbsp; ⚙️

<br>
First, install the packages and run the development server:

<br>

    npm install && npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

If you see this, you're ready to start turning this template into your own **SaaS marketing page** 👌

## How to use this documentation 📄

There are five sections, and each has specific instructions to help you modify its content.

#### First, get familiar with Tailwind CSS
Follow this link if you're new to Tailwind: [Tailwind Installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

- Your Tailwind settings are already configured. You only need to use the basic CSS classes provided by Tailwind to adjust colors, sizes, margins, paddings, etc.

But how do you do this?

- Use your editor’s quick search feature to find Tailwind classes. You can also try ´ctrl + k´ / 'cmd + k'
 
  ![alt text](readme-img/image-3.png)

For example, if you want to change colors:

- Scroll through the search results and look for "customizing colors".

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-4.png)

<br>

All color codes are ready for you—just type the color name and token code. For instance, using "slate-50" will give you the color `#f8fafc`.

In Tailwind, you assign styles by adding class names to elements. For example:

Adding the class `background-slate-50` to an element will apply the slate-50 background color.

<br>

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-6.png)

#### ✨ Important Hint:
If you ever forget the name of a CSS flex setting, don't waste time scrolling through the documentation. Instead, ask your coding assistant (GPT, Copilot, Gemini) for help—it saves time and frustration!

Tailwind is simpler than it seems; you’ll grasp the essentials in 10-15 minutes. For this project, simply updating the content is enough to create your personalized SaaS landing page.

#### Second, let's get to know the components and their content.

- **Banner** 🏠  
  A section featuring a bold headline, a concise subheading, a compelling call-to-action button, and a dynamic background (vide but you can change it with an img also).  

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-7.png)
  <br><br>


- **Clients** 🔍  
  As clear as the name the companies that you worked with represented in a fancy way with a constant sliding and grayscale.  

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-9.png)
  <br><br>

- **About** 🙎‍♂️  
  A section that explains the purpose of your SaaS product, highlights its benefits, and may include a brief introduction along with engaging visuals.

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-10.png)
  <br><br>

- **Features** 🔄  
  The part that you showcase best features of your product. 

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-11.png)
  <br><br>

- **Tools** 🛠  
  A showcase of the technologies and tools that power your SaaS product. 

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-12.png) 
  <br><br>

- **How It Works** 🔄  
  A step-by-step guide that demonstrates how your product operates, making it easy for visitors to understand its benefits. 

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-13.png) 
  <br><br>

- **Pricing** 💰  
  A section displaying various pricing plans and packages, helping visitors choose the option that best fits their needs.

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-15.png)
  <br><br>

- **Testimonials** 💬  
  A carousel or slider showcasing feedback and reviews from satisfied customers.

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-16.png)  
  <br><br>


- **CTA** 🚀  
  A compelling call-to-action section encouraging visitors to sign up or try your product. 
  
  ![alt text](readme-img/image-17.png) 
  <br><br>

- **Contact** 📞  
  A section providing your contact details—including email and social media links—so visitors can easily reach out.  
  <br><br>

- **Footer** 🔗  
  The bottom navigation area with additional links, social media icons, and any other relevant information. 

  ![alt text](readme-img/image-18.png) 
  <br><br>

#### The section names and their content may seem complicated in the project files. No worries, let's check the folder structure together:

![alt text](readme-img/image-19.png)

<br>

Inside the app folder, you'll find the global files. These files set up the foundational structure, styles, and layouts used across the entire application.

![alt text](readme-img/image-21.png)

<br>

#### - layout.tsx  
This file is responsible for structuring the HTML layout of the application and including global UI components that remain consistent across all pages.

- It **imports global styles** from `"@/styles/globals.css"`, ensuring consistent design across the site.
- The **Navbar** and **Footer** components are included, meaning they are rendered on every page.
- It defines **metadata** (`title` and `description`) for the SaaS landing page, improving SEO.
- The `<main>` element wraps the `{children}` prop, which dynamically renders the content of different pages inside the layout.
- The entire application is wrapped inside `<html lang="en">` to set the language attribute properly.

This file ensures that every page has a **consistent layout**, with a navigation bar at the top, a main content area in the center, and a footer at the bottom.

<br>
 
#### - page.tsx 

This is our main page that renders everything. It includes all the sections—from the Navbar to the Contact section—in a container that defines the overall layout of the page.

It imports and renders all the key sections inside a `<main>` element, ensuring the correct structure and flow of the landing page.

- It **imports** components such as **Banner, Clients, About, Features, Tools, How It Works, Pricing, Testimonials, and CTA**.
- These components are **displayed sequentially**, forming the complete SaaS landing page.
- The `'use client'` directive ensures that the page is treated as a client-side component.

This file is responsible for assembling all sections into a fully functional landing page.

<br>

#### - not-found.tsx  
This file defines the **custom 404 (Not Found) page** for the SaaSLand project. It ensures that users who navigate to a non-existent route see a well-designed error page instead of a generic browser error.

- Displays a **"404"** heading, indicating that the page was not found.
- Shows a **message** informing users that the page might have been moved or doesn’t exist.
- Includes a **"Return Home"** button, allowing users to navigate back to the homepage.
- Uses **Next.js’s `Link` component** for efficient client-side navigation.
- The page is centered vertically and horizontally using **Tailwind CSS classes** for a clean UI.

This file ensures a **user-friendly error experience** by providing a clear message and an easy way to return to the main site.


#### ✨ Important Hint:
If you simply "Ctrl + Click" (Windows) or "Cmd + Click" (Mac) on a component's name in your code editor, you'll jump directly to its code. This is the easiest way to navigate between components.

## Component-Specific Instructions &nbsp; 🌄

How to modify the components will be explained more specifically below. If you are already a dev most probably you do not need that parts. However if you want some ai tool to manage this code and you lack the knowledge you can use the explanations below, it will take much less time 🤫
